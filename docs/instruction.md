Target Tracking mode is a training method focused on improving players' ability to track moving targets. Here are the implementation mechanisms and characteristics of this mode:

## **Key Differences**

| Features | Target Tracking Mode | Moving Targets Mode |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Target Movement** | Targets move continuously, requiring players to maintain aim and track their movement paths. | Targets move randomly on screen, typically appearing briefly before disappearing. |
| **Training Focus** | Emphasizes continuous tracking ability and accuracy for dynamic targets. | Focuses on quick reaction and aiming skills, suitable for training responses to suddenly appearing targets. |
| **Target Size** | Targets are typically larger to facilitate tracking while aiming. | Targets can be small or medium-sized, increasing shooting challenge. |
| **Movement Path** | Target movement paths can be linear or complex curves, simulating real combat scenarios. | Target movement is typically random and fast-changing. |
| **Feedback Mechanism** | Provides detailed feedback on tracking precision and reaction time. | Provides statistics like hit rate and reaction speed, emphasizing quick responses. |

## **Summary**

- **Target Tracking Mode** focuses on improving players' ability to track moving targets, requiring players to maintain aim while targets move continuously, thus developing higher levels of accuracy and control.

- **Moving Targets Mode** emphasizes quick reaction and instantaneous aiming ability, requiring players to respond rapidly between target appearances and disappearances.

Both modes have their own focus and can be chosen based on players' needs and skill levels to achieve optimal training results.
